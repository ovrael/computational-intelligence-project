## General info

This is our academic project for "Computational intelligence" classes. <br>
There's funny history behind it :) <br>
We have client who didn't describe his idea properly and we had to play "requierements game" where we had 9 questions to ask to get better knowledge about whole concept. <br>

Clients wants to distribute his goods between points of interests. 🏠 🏭 🏣	 <br>
He has fleet of vehicles with different capacity. 🚙 🚛	🚚	🛻 <br>
We have 3 types of goods to deliver: oranges, tuna and uran 😁	<br>
But be careful because there can be cat in one of the vehicles that eats tuna! 😼 <br>
Each point of interest has different request to accomplish. 🤔 <br>
<br> Our goal is to find the best route for fleet to maximize profit ↗️ and minimize route length ↘️.

## Technologies

Front-end:
* Unity v TBD

Back-end:
* C# v 11.0
* .NET v 7.0

* GitHub

## Features

* Configurable data such as: number of points of interests, fleet size, truck capacities, hire cat etc.
* Creating random map of points of interests.
* Finding one of the best routes.

## Status

Project status: _in preparing_

That means we are planning what to do and how we do it.
